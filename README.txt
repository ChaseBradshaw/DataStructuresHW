DNA Homework Assignment

The Good:
Program compiles & runs

The Bad:
Program does not run on loop

The Ugly:
I cannot figure out why my A G T C statistics will not print into file
Was confused about calculating Gaussian Distribution, I tried but used data from the probability of a single character being A C T G
to determine how I create my new mystery strings
I looked on your blackboard page and on slack, could not find anything about a makerfile.
